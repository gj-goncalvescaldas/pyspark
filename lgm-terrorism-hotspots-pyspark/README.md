## üìù Assignment

Imagine you are a **security or defense analyst**. Your task is to analyze the data and draw conclusions about the **distribution** and **nature** of terrorist incidents recorded around the world. Your analysis should include **maps** that visualize the location of different incidents. You may consider answering the following questions:

- üìà How has the number of terrorist activities changed over the years? Are there specific regions where this trend differs from global averages?
- üíÄ Is there a correlation between the number of incidents and the number of casualties? Can you spot any irregularities or outliers?
- üî´ What are the most common methods of attacks? Do they vary across regions or time periods?
- üó∫Ô∏è Plot the locations of attacks on a map to visualize their regional spread.

Feel free to explore the data further and extract **additional insights** beyond these suggested questions.

## üßæ Data Description

The provided compressed file `globalterrorismdb_0718dist.tar.bz2` is an extract from the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)** ‚Äî an open-source database containing information on **terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 through 2017**.

The GTD includes systematic data on both **domestic and international** terrorist incidents, with over **180,000 recorded attacks**. It is maintained by the **National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)**, based at the **University of Maryland**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Since the number of variables and records is very large, you're encouraged to **select a subset of columns** or **focus on a specific timeframe** for your analysis.

## üß™ Hint: How to Load the Data

The `.tar.bz2` file is a compressed CSV. You can load it into a Pandas DataFrame like this:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("globalterrorismdb_0718dist.tar.bz2", compression="bz2")
